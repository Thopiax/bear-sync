# BearSync

## How to use

1. Make sure you have Dropbox installed and in your path (`~/Dropbox`).
2. Make sure you also have Bear installed from the App Store (last known working version `v1.5.5`)
3. Run `git clone git@github.com:Thopiax/bear-sync.git` (if you have a golang path setup with bin, src, pkg, etc. put it on there)
4. Run `cd bear-sync`.
5. Run `./bearsync` (with the optional `-dropboxPath` flag to tell the script exactly where the config is inside dropbox)
